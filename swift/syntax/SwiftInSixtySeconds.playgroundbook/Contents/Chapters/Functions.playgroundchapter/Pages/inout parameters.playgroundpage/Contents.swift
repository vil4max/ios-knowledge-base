/*:
# inout parameters
All parameters passed into a Swift function are *constants*, so you can’t change them. If you want, you can pass in one or more parameters as `inout`, which means they can be changed inside your function, and those changes reflect in the original value outside the function.

For example, if you want to double a number in place – i.e., change the value directly rather than returning a new one – you might write a function like this:
*/
//#-editable-code Enter your code here
func doubleInPlace(number: inout Int) {
    number *= 2
}
//#-end-editable-code
/*:
To use that, you first need to make a variable integer – you can’t use constant integers with `inout`, because they might be changed. You also need to pass the parameter to `doubleInPlace` using an ampersand, `&`, before its name, which is an explicit recognition that you’re aware it is being used as `inout`.

In code, you’d write this:
*/
//#-editable-code Enter your code here
var myNum = 10 
doubleInPlace(number: &myNum)
//#-end-editable-code
