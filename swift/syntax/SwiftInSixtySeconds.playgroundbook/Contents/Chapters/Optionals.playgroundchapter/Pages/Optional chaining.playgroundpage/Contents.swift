# Optional chaining
Swift provides us with a shortcut when using optionals: if you want to access something like `a.b.c` and `b` is optional, you can write a question mark after it to enable *optional chaining*: `a.b?.c`.

When that code is run, Swift will check whether `b` has a value, and if it’s `nil` the rest of the line will be ignored – Swift will return `nil` immediately. But if it *has* a value, it will be unwrapped and execution will continue.

To try this out, here’s an array of names:
*/
//#-editable-code Enter your code here
let names = ["John", "Paul", "George", "Ringo"]
//#-end-editable-code
/*:
We’re going to use the `first` property of that array, which will return the first name if there is one or `nil` if the array is empty. We can then call `uppercased()` on the result to make it an uppercase string:
*/
//#-editable-code Enter your code here
let beatle = names.first?.uppercased()
//#-end-editable-code
/*:
That question mark is optional chaining – if `first` returns `nil` then Swift won’t try to uppercase it, and will set `beatle` to `nil` immediately.*/
